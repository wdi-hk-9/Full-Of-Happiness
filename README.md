# Game Project: Full-Of-Happiness
=======

## Game Play
- When you see bubbles come out, just simply click/touch bubbles and turn them all into happy faces


## Objective
Make something that will bring people immediate happeness. Just like when I get suck in the programming these days, once I click the bubble, I will see a smiley face and feel great!

## Design & Background
- Intuitive game design - people knows how to play without explanation
- Coca Cola has a very successful campaign called Open Happiness. It match my theme of project and the bubbles of the coke is a good element for me to play with in the game

## What I try to achieve in this project
- Create an addictive game that will bring progressive enhancement of challenge, fun and rewards to players

### Challenge:
- When game passes only, more bubbles will come up with variation in speed

### Fun and Rewards:
- The game will fill up the screen full of smiley faces. That's why the game is named as "Full of Happiness"
- I try to make a game that will keep saying - "You are great!", "You are beautiful!", "You are Awesome"
